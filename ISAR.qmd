# Information Storage and Retrieval System (ISAR) {background-color="#438496"}

## ISAR

### Definition 1

According to Sparck Jones an Information Retrieval System is a set of
rules and procedures, for performing some or all of the following
operations:

a)  Indexing (or constructing of representations of document)

b)  Search formulation (or constructing of representations of
    information needs)

c)  Searching (or matching representations of documents against
    representations of needs)

d)  Index language construction (or generation of rules of
    representation)

## ISAR (Cont.)

### Definition 2

-   According to Kowalski "An information retrieval system is a system
    that is capable of storage, retrieval and maintenance of
    information. Information in this context can be composed of text
    (including numeric and date data), images, audio, video and other
    multi-media objects. Although the form of an object in an IRS is
    diverse, the text aspect has been the only data type that lent
    itself to full functional processing. Other data types have been
    treated as highly informative sources but are primarily linked for
    retrieval based upon search of the text".

## ISAR PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  **Information Facilitator**: It should act as facilitator between
    information contained in the document & the user

2.  **Non-Ambiguous**: Ambiguity of information is avoided so that
    search result is free from any kind of ambiguity
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
3.  **Minimum Time**: System should be so designed that minimum effort
    and time are spent to interrogate the system
4.  **User-Friendliness**: ISAR should have user friendly interface. The
    important aspects of ISAR should be highlighted
:::

## ISAR FEATURES

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  Competence and compatibility for consolidated searching and
    retrieval of information from any client terminal from any database
    within the system

2.  It should be able to narrowcast or broadcast or relate the
    information need in a variety of associations to get optimum
    retrieval performance
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
3.  It should have access facilities at multi-points

4.  It should have common command language facility to retrieve info.
    from several databases of the system

5.  It should be able to handle info. access from entity-related or
    object-oriented approaches
:::
:::

## ISAR FEATURES (Cont.)

6.  It should have the ability to select, classify, process and
    consolidate the analysed information into a cohesive text ready for
    assimilation by the end-users
7.  It should have ability to orient the information to specialist needs
    of the users from time to time. This calls for understanding the
    processing of user profiles
8.  It should be able to retrieve maximum information with minimum
    number of clues. The fuzzy approaches of end-users must be able to
    get clarified and ultimate result should provide satisfaction to the
    searcher
9.  It should have capacity to interchange the information available in
    one database or another for purposes of retrieval relevance end
    usage

## ISAR FEATURES (Cont.)

10. It should have bibliographic data interchange capacity (using Z39.50
    or similar standard) to meet consolidation to a chosen format for
    networking and other purposes. Compatibility with standards at all
    levels must be the goal
11. It should have ability to search simple information quickly in an
    easy manner and also have the ability to multi-track the complex
    questions and present them in a simple easy manner. User-friendly
    presentations are very important.

## ISAR COMPONENTS

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
F.W Lancaster (1979) mentioned that information retrieval system
comprises six major subsystem:

1.  Document subsystem
2.  Indexing subsystem
3.  Vocabulary subsystem
4.  Searching subsystem
5.  User system interface
6.  Machine subsystem
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
These sub-systems are utilised in the performance of the following
activities:

-   information resource building,
-   database creation and maintenance, and
-   information retrieval and dissemination
:::
:::

## ISAR COMPONENTS (Cont.)

-   An ISAR system comprises of following components:

1.  **User Interface**: It is the front-end which enables user to put a
    query and displays results. These are of two types:

    -   Query Interface
    -   Result Interface

2.  **Knowledge Base**: The store house of any ISAR system is its
    Knowledge Base. It contains list of facts or related facts
    (information). Any kind of query is answered based on the facts
    stored in the Knowledge Base. A Knowledge Base could be a DBMS.
    Retrieval of information from storage depends on two important
    aspects of Knowledge Base:

## ISAR COMPONENTS (Cont.)

(i) Knowledge Representation
    a.  Semantic Network Knowledge Representation - A semantic network
        contains points called nodes connected by links called as arcs
    b.  Frame Based Knowledge Representation - It is and object-oriented
        approach. A *frame* represents an object (document or
        information) or class of objects and are stored in *slots*
    c.  Rule-Based Knowledge Representation - Rules provide a formal way
        of representing recommendations, directives, or strategies.
        Rules are appropriate when the domain knowledge results from
        empirical associations developed through years of experience in

## ISAR COMPONENTS (Cont.)

solving problems in a given area. Rules are expressed in the form of
IF-THEN statements. In a rule based expert system, the domain knowledge
is represented as a set of rules that are checked against a collection
of facts or knowledge about the current situation. When the IF portion
of the rule is satisfied by the facts, the action specified by the THEN
portion is performed. When the condition is satisfied the rule is said
to 'fire' or 'execute'. A rule interpreter is used to compare the IF
portions of rules with the facts and execute the rule whose IF portion
matches the facts.

## ISAR COMPONENTS (Cont.)

(ii) Indexing & clustering - Many system follow a kind of keyword
     indexing. Keyword indexes are sometimes good in recall not
     inprecision and in some cases vice-versa.Such indexes fail in
     preserving the context of search term. Eg. World Wide Web

Efforts have made in this direction such as using clustering techniques
like keyword clustering to attach semantics with a keyword. In such a
technique, relation among the terms are used like Broader term, Narrower
term and Related term. This technique heavily uses Thesaurus. Such
relations can be stored in the form of sequential inverted files or
using B-tree structures.

## ISAR COMPONENTS (Cont.)

3.  Search Agent - It is a program which takes input from Search
    Interface and searches in the Knowledge Base using existing index.

-   A good ISAR system means efficient retrieval. Thus, a good search
    agent must be equipped with following features:
    -   facility of using Boolean operators
    -   context setting to search terms
    -   use of clustering algorithms
    -   use of soundex and metaphone algorithms

3.  Search Agent
    A.  **Boolean Operators**

-   Three Boolean operators are AND, OR and NOT

-   These operators are used to generate combinational search

-   AND and NOT operators increase precision whereas OR increases recall
    of search results

## ISAR COMPONENTS (Cont.)

B.  **Context Setting**

-   It requires content analysis of document

-   It can be done manually or automatically to preserve the context of
    each term in the index. It can be done in two ways:

    a.  Conceptual Analysis: It is the frequency of concepts. Concept
        can be represented by texts as well as pictures where text is
        very common. For example, if one is analyzing with a hypothesis
        that a certain document is about *freedom* then one should look
        for the related words like *liberation, independence*, etc.

## ISAR COMPONENTS (Cont.)

b.  Relational Analysis: It goes one step further by examining the
    relationships among concepts in a text. In relational analysis we
    look for what are the related words appearing next to the word in
    question. For example, to see what are the words that appear next to
    "freedom" and then determine the related concepts

<!-- -->

C.  **Clustering Algorithms**

-   Clustering is a method by which large sets of data is grouped into
    groups or clusters of smaller sets of similar data based on some
    characteristics

## ISAR COMPONENTS (Cont.)

-   It attempts to identify natural groups of components or data based
    on some similarity in a given population.

-   It is a method to create sub-class in a given class

-   The first thing in such algorithms are identification of core entity
    which is also known as centroid

-   Around centroid similar kind of entities or data are collected which
    are called as members of cluster

-   To determine cluster membership and size, most algorithms evaluate
    the distance between each entity or data and the cluster centroids

## ISAR COMPONENTS (Cont.)

-   Statistical techniques are used for generating clusters as output

![](images/clustering.png){fig-align="center" width="1000"}

## ISAR COMPONENTS (Cont.)

4.  Soundex & Metaphone Algorithms

-   Both these algorithms are based in the way pronunciation of a word
    is made

-   In soundex algorithm, a numeric code is assigned to each character
    used in a word and when search is performed, words with similar
    codes are also brought out in search result

-   Whereas metaphone algorithm encodes on letter-by-letter basis. It
    encodes groups of letters i.e. a word. It embodies more accuratelt
    the rules of pronounciation in language

## ISAR FUNCTIONS

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   IR system is considered to have the function of "leading the user to
    those documents that will best enable him/her to satisfy his/her
    need for information" (Lancaster, 1979)
-   Information is stored in natural language texts, and the mechanism
    used to represent the texts include both controlled &
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/functions.png){fig-align="center" width="1000"} uncontrolled
vocab. which separately or in combination constitute the indexing
language
:::
:::

## TYPES OF ISAR SYSTEMS

1.  Database Management System (DBMS)

-   It deals with data storage, maintenance and retrieval and is used to
    keep control and manipulate data within the database

-   It has the definite structure of the stored information, instead of
    dealing with natural language text

-   In DBMS, normally files of data are described by a small set of
    pre-specified attributes. Each attribute carries some kind of value
    in it.

For example: Records of books' authors, title, publisher, year, etc

## TYPES OF ISAR SYSTEMS (Cont.)

-   Therefore, a DBMS can be defined as set of records and each record
    contains fields (attributes) which in turn contain data (value). A
    database may contain textual, numeric, statistical and graphical
    information

-   OPAC is a kind of DBMS often built of some kind of Bibliographic
    Database Management Systems (BDBMS)

2.  Text Retrieval System

-   They are designed for unstructured data such as full text documents

-   Queries are based on keywords and a no. of advanced search
    techniques (such as proximity search) can be used

## TYPES OF ISAR SYSTEMS (Cont.)

3.  Management Information System (MIS)

-   It is a DBMS designed to cope up with the needs of management
    professionals who need to have information about different
    alternatives related to their interest to facilitate their work

4.  Decision Support System (DSS)

-   DSS helps top-level management in arriving at decisions. There is
    very little difference between MIS & DSS. The former generated
    reports in anticipation or on demand and collect facts, whereas
    later provides alternative solutions

## TYPES OF ISAR SYSTEMS (Cont.)

5.  Knowledge Based System (KBS)

-   Specialized computer programs, modeled in the same way as human
    experts tackle problems and arrive at solutions are called Expert
    Systems

-   Such systems rely upon a store of specialized knowledge for solving
    problems and hence referred to as KBCS

## EVALUATION OF ISAR SYSTEMS

According to Claverdon and others, any ISAR system can be evaluated
based on:

-   Coverage of the collections
-   Time lag (average interval between search request is made and answer
    is given)
-   Form of Presentation of the Output
-   Efforts involved on user's part in obtaining answers to their search
    requests
-   Recall of the system, that is, the proportion of relevant material
    actually retrieved in answer to a search request
-   Precision of the system, that is, the proportion of retrieved
    material that is actually relevant

## EXAMPLES OF ISAR SYSTEMS

1.  OPAC: Library catalogue has changed its form to the electronic form
    with the advent of computerisation called OPAC. OPAC provides access
    to the documents by different approaches of users, such as Author,
    Collaborator, Title, Subject, Keyword, etc. An OPAC is built on DBMS
2.  Digital Library: OPAC only provides bibliographic details not
    full-text information. This limitation led to development of
    full-text databases in digital form. This kind of database is known
    as Digital Library. Digital libraries are available over network
    often using World Wide Web

## EXAMPLES OF ISAR SYSTEMS (Cont.)

3.  Search Engines: WWW is itself is a big source of information. Almost
    everything and anything can be found over Internet. Search Engines
    provide a kind of interface for users to search the web. A Search
    Engine basically has three components:

    -   Web Crawler
    -   Database
    -   Agent

## EXAMPLES OF ISAR SYSTEMS (Cont.)

-   Web Crawler goes to each and every site over Internet and indexes
    each word present in the page or sometimes few lines from the page.
    This index is stored in search engines database with corresponding
    URL (Uniform Resource Locator). When a search query is given it
    searches in databases of search engine and result is generated

-   Search Engines can be categorised into three main types:

    -   Individual Search Engines -- text or image based search engine,
        for example, Google (www.google.com)

## EXAMPLES OF ISAR SYSTEMS (Cont.)

-   Search Engines
    -   Subject Directories -- subject-based search engines, for
        example, Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com)
    -   Meta-search Engines -- search engine of search engines, for
        example, Askjeeves (www.askjeeves.com)

## IR SEARCHING TECHNIQUES

-   In bibliographic IR environment, searches can be divided into two
    main classes:

(i) **Known item search** is the one where the user knows something
    about the item being sought such as author, title, publisher, ISBN,
    etc.

(ii) **Unknown item search** is the one where users are not aware of the
     existence of any document that may solve their problems.

## IR SEARCHING TECHNIQUES (Cont.)

1.  Exact Match Search: The search engine will only match query terms
    exactly; it does not allow for truncation, wildcards, or stemming.
    Exact Match option is nowadays available in Internet-based databases
    to retrieve more relevant information. Phrase search can be
    characterized as exact match search, where a phrase is given at the
    search query that searches whole phrase.

2.  Best Match Search: In best match search, the search engine will
    match query terms closely, if not exactly. It may allow for
    truncation, wildcards, or stemming. Best Match search is performed,
    when exact match could not fetch sufficient number of relevant
    information.

## IR SEARCHING TECHNIQUES (Cont.)

3.  Partial Match Search: A partial match is one that matches one or
    more characters at the end of the text input, but did not match all
    of the regular expression, although, it may have done so had more
    input been available. Partial matches are typically used when either
    validating data input,

![](images/reverse.png) checking each character as it is entered on the
keyboard, or when searching texts that are either too long to load into
memory.

## IR MODELS

-   On the basis of input and the output, Information Retrieval Models
    can be grouped into three basic categories:

1.  Data Retrieval Model

-- Data retrieval model essentially handles data

-- A data retrieval model calls for organisational structure based on
various criteria such as properties, clusters and other different
entities

-- There is a need for a taxonomic presentation of these aspects.

## IR MODELS (Cont.)

-- Such a taxonomic presentation must also be accessible from other
types of associations

-- A searcher of a data comes for a specific information retrieval.
Therefore, the expression of information need should be very precise

-- Therefore, the data retrieval model is a simple model of information
retrieval needing specific matching techniques viz., a taxonomic
structure of the various entities involved and their properties.

2.  Information Retrieval Model

-- Information is data oriented to a purpose

## IR MODELS (Cont.)

-- It actually combines several data into a relational structure

-- It is a more complex model

-- It has to generally comprehend multi-dimensional relationships

-- It is not amenable easily to a taxonomic structure

-- The representation of information is to be based on a relational
database structure using some associative mathematics

-- The expression of information need is also complex and time consuming

## IR MODELS (Cont.)

-- It draws out for a long conversational or browsing process and the
information retrieval model must incorporate such facilities and
interfaces

3.  Knowledge Retrieval Model

-- Knowledge is a kind of integration of general types of information

-- It normally occurs in the human mind. The human mind infers and
integrates several coordinates with the information received by it

-- Knowledge is assimilated information. To facilitate decision-making
and problem solving, intelligent knowledge based IR models are coming up

## IR MODELS (Cont.)

-- Such systems comprise three basic aspects:

-   Knowledge Base
-   Inference Engine
-   User Interface

## IR MODELS BASED ON THEORIES & TOOLS

1.  Boolean Retrieval Model

    -   Standard
    -   Weighted: Weighting is the process of assigning an importance to
        an index term's use in an item

2.  Fuzzy Logic Model

-- ISAR has software component that has the features and functions
required to manipulate 'information' items

-- This information is regarded as fuzzy text

## IR MODELS BASED ON..(Cont.)

-- The term 'fuzzy' is used to imply the results from the minimal
standards or controls on the creators of the text items

-- The author presents concepts, ideas and abstractions along with
supporting facts

-- Resulting in minimal consistency in the vocabulary and styles of
items

-- The searcher has to be omniscient to specify all search term
possibilities in the query

-- Fuzzy retrieval provide the capability to locate spellings of words
that are similar to the entered search term. This function is primarily
used to compensate for errors in spelling of words

## IR MODELS BASED ON..(Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-- Fuzzy retrieval increases recall at the expense of decreasing
precision

-- For example, a fuzzy search on the term 'computer' would
automatically include the following words from the information database:
'computer', 'compiter', 'computter', 'compute'

-- Fuzzy retrieval has its maximum utilisation in a
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-- system that accepts items that have been optical character recognised

-- In OCR process, a hardcopy item is scanned into a binary image

-- Due to character errors throughout the text in OCR process, fuzzy
retrieval allows location of items of interest compensating for the
erroneous characters
:::
:::

## IR MODELS BASED ON..(Cont.)

3.  Vector Space Model

-- It represents the documents & queries as vectors in a
multidimensional space, whose dimensions are the terms used to build an
index to represent the documents
